# Usage Instructions

**You can use the Bitwarden browser extension on:**
- Firefox (with Socks5 Proxy enabled) - (Mac, Windows, Linux, Android)
- Tor Browser - (Mac, Windows, Linux, Android)

**You can use the Android Bitwarden native app with Orbot running in VPN mode**

**Finally, you can access your Bitwarden web vault by visiting its Tor Address from any Tor-enabled browser.**

The screenshots below are for Tor Browser on Mac, but it is the same basic for instuctions for using the extension on alternative platforms.

6. Click “Create Account” and fill in the required fields.

This *does not* mean you are creating an account with Bitwarden or any other third party. You are creating an account with yourself on your own Embassy. It’s awesome!

## Important!!

Bitwarden on the Embassy is a *self-hosted* password manager, which means your passwords physically live on your Embassy. Be sure to create backups and keep them safe. If you lose your Embassy or uninstall Bitwarden, and you have not made a backup, all your passwords will be lost forever.
