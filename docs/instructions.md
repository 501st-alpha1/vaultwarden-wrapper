6. Click “Create Account” and fill in the required fields.

This *does not* mean you are creating an account with Bitwarden or any other third party. You are creating an account with yourself on your own Embassy. It’s awesome!

## Keep in Mind

Bitwarden on the Embassy is a *self-hosted* password manager, which means your passwords physically live on your Embassy. Be sure to create backups and keep them safe. If you lose your Embassy or uninstall Bitwarden, and you have not made a backup, all your passwords will be lost forever.
