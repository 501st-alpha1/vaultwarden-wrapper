# Vaultwarden Setup Guide and Integrations

Please note that the version of Bitwarden server used on the Embassy is a fork called "Vaultwarden." Despite this, it still functions with several of the apps/integrations that are built for, and still named after, "Bitwarden." We apologize for any confusion this may cause.


For usage, please refer to our website for the latest information.
